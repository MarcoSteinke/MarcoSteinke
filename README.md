Check out my collection of [`Machine learning resources`](https://github.com/MarcoSteinke/Machine-Learning-Resources)

I am working on a social network, which's first goal is to provide a platform on which citizens and officials can work together, to clean cities and fight vandalism. Get in touch [`here`](https://github.com/vanfix-social-network).

I started to make standard cameras smart and use them for surveillance, check it out: [`here`](https://github.com/MarcoSteinke/survAPI-Surveillance-Camera-Analysis)

Check out my github repositories for project ideas or implementations of foundational concepts of software development and software architecture.

### üìù Interested in reading something?

I am creating blog posts and may have an interesting read for you:

- [Text Prediction using Bigrams and Markov Models](https://bestofcode.net/blog/text-prediction/)
- [Text Generation using the Bigrams from previous post](https://bestofcode.net/blog/text-generation/)

#### Currently writing the following blog post:

- [Using Neural Networks to learn some predictions for political contexts](https://github.com/MarcoSteinke/Machine-Learning-Resources/blob/main/implementation/political-parties/README.adoc#using-neural-networks-to-learn-some-predictions-for-political-contexts)
