### About:
My Name is Marco Steinke and I am a CS student from Germany. In my freetime I love to create Web Applications/Websites and also Skating.
My main focus is my work in the web. I built a small social network, multiple database applications and also built a forum software in a team of 8.

#### MovingPoint Game Engine:

A lightweight engine to develop games, animations or simulations. After working a while with GMS, Unity I got trouble by the size of the project files and also of the imported libraries. I wanted to create some small things and firstly need Windows to run Unity and GMS and secondly enough Hardware.


The main focus of this project is to create an environment in which programmers can design small games while using a minimal amount of resources.

This engine is developed with the goal of intuitivity, so that a programmer which starts using MovingPoint will be able to use the same structure as in other game engines.

If you want to create small Apps or simple Games (grid based or procedural) you will get a toolkit which includes all required methods and objects to reach your goal.

Pokemon Master Trainer is developed by a small team of programmers from Germany.

The main motivation of this project is to bring Pokemon everywhere and make it playable on all devices. Sitting in the bus, having spare 5 minutes at home. Playing something the last 30 minutes before going to sleep.
