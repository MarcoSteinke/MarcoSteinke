## ❓ Problem:

A business needs a security camera, but is low on server capacity. Thatswhy the business
can not store videos 24/7.

## 💡 Solution:

Using Machine Learning, we can tell the camera when it has objects in view and use a lightweight
backend to store the timestamps and also the type of objects which where detected.
